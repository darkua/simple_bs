I have used rebar to deploy the app, so in order to run just compile, create a release and lunch it with console attached.

./rebar compile eunit

will compile the app simple_bs and run automatically the tests

./rebar generate

will generate a embeded system only for this app that you can use this script to run

sh rel/simple_bs/bin/simple_bs console

And you can simple test it like this:

(simple_bs@127.0.0.1)1> simple_bs_srv:insert(7).
ok
(simple_bs@127.0.0.1)2> simple_bs_srv:withdrawl(70).
ok
(simple_bs@127.0.0.1)3> simple_bs_srv:get_balance().
Bank System Balance : -63
ok

The code itself can be found all in simple_bs_srv.erl and i used edoc for generating documentation for it.

As long as i could get the objective was to build a simple unique balance for the "bank" account so witch user inserts or gets the money does not really matters.
